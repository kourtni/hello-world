# hello-world
_All the Helloz._

## Purpose
This repository has a couple of purposes.
* First, it is intended to hold all `Hello World` type projects I decide to do.
* Second, and perhaps more importantly, it will be used to demonstrate the ability to implement a polyglot monorepo.

## Requirements
There are also two requirements.
1. All of the projects must be able to be run. Which means that the repository must be configured to properly support each project's coding language.
2. Each project should be easily exportable. Which means that the projects should be callable from other projects inside and outside of the repo.
