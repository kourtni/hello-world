# hello-world
_All the Helloz._

## Purpose
This repository has a couple of purposes.
* First, it is intended to hold all `Hello World` type projects I decide to do.
* Second, and perhaps more importantly, it will be used to demonstrate the ability to implement a polyglot monorepo.

## Requirements
There is really on one requirement, and that is that all of the projects must be able to be run.
Which means that the repository must be configured to properly support each project's coding language.
